# SMS_Controlled_AC_Switch
This project demonstrates the design and simulation of an SMS-controlled AC appliance switch using embedded systems principles. The system allows a user to remotely turn an AC load ON or OFF by sending SMS commands through a GSM network.


This project idea was inspired by [Opstepe Projects](https://opstep.com/projects/). Their work provided guidance and inspiration for designing an SMS-controlled AC switch.
